# Point mass under gravity in vacuum. 26 Oct 2025
"""This project explores physics animation with the simple force of gravity on a point
mass. The goal is to produce a real time video of the behaviour of the point mass
under constant downward acceleration in vacuum.
"""

""" Formulae:
    - Gravity Fg = G * M*m / r**2
    - Acceleration Fg = m*a
    - Velocity v = a*t
    - Distance d = v*t
